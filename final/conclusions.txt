aboveaverage.py

    In the above average program the goal was to be able to calculate the average, percetage of people in the list above that average and if the student is above average. The first step I knew I had to accomplesh was to read the file. I then initialized variables for specific reasons, for instance on line 20 the total variables was to store the sum of all the numbers in the list, this is so that we could calculate the average in line 28. In line 30 to 32 I just simply added to the aboveAvgPercent variable and then turned it into a percent on line 34 to get all people above the average.  

yahtzee.py

    In this yahtzee program I had to calculate how many attempts it would take to roll 5 sixes and display the average of attempts over 1000 games. This was a pretty strait forward problem using the random import and calculating the average. I used two function as seen on line 7 and 10. I used a rollDice method to return a random number between 1 and 6 as well as a method called experiment that returns the amount of attempts it would take for 1 game of yahtzee. Now that I have that method written we can use it on line 24 to return experiment() and add to the 'total' variable then just take the total and divide it by 1000 to get the average over 1000 games. Then we simply print the output using 'f' at the beginning of the string inside the print statement to format the string.
